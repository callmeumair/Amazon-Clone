# Amazon-Clone
An Amazon clone is an e-commerce platform designed to replicate the features and functionalities of Amazon, one of the worldâ€™s largest online marketplaces. It enables users to browse and purchase a wide range of products, including electronics, clothing, home essentials, books, and more. The platform typically includes user-friendly navigation, advanced search filters, product recommendations, customer reviews, and secure payment gateways.

For sellers, an Amazon clone provides a multi-vendor system where businesses can list products, manage inventory, track orders, and handle customer interactions. Buyers can enjoy seamless shopping experiences with features like wish lists, personalized suggestions, order tracking, and multiple payment options.
